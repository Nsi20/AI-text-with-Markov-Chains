# Pix2Pix: Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional GANs  

This repository implements the **pix2pix** image-to-image translation model using a **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)**. The model was trained on paired image datasets (facades) to learn how to generate target images (e.g., architectural labels) from corresponding input images (building facades).

## **Project Overview**  
This project demonstrates image-to-image translation tasks using **pix2pix**, a supervised GAN model. Example use cases include:  
- Generating **semantic labels** for buildings (facades).  
- Transforming **edges to photo-realistic images** (e.g., edges2shoes dataset).  
- Generating maps from satellite images.  

The core components of this project include:  
1. **Dataset preprocessing** for paired image inputs.  
2. A **cGAN-based pix2pix model** implementation.  
3. Training the model on the facades dataset.  
4. **Visualization of results** and model performance.

## **Dataset**  
The project uses the **pix2pix facades dataset**, which consists of **paired input-output images**:  
- Input: Building facades  
- Target: Semantic labels of building structures  

### Dataset Structure:  
```
facades/
    ├── train/   # Training images
    ├── val/     # Validation images
    └── test/    # Test images
```  
The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle using `kagglehub`.  

**Download command**:  
```python
import kagglehub

path = kagglehub.dataset_download("vikramtiwari/pix2pix-dataset")
```

## **Setup Instructions**  

Follow these steps to set up the project in **Google Colab** or your local environment:  

### 1. **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pix2pix-image-translation.git
cd pix2pix-image-translation
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras kagglehub matplotlib numpy
```

### 3. **Prepare the Dataset**  
Download the dataset as described above and place it in the correct directory.

## **Model Architecture**  

The pix2pix architecture consists of:  

1. **Generator (U-Net)**:  
   - A U-Net architecture generates the target image conditioned on the input image.  
   - Input → Downsampling (Conv2D) → Upsampling (Transpose Conv2D) → Output  

2. **Discriminator (PatchGAN)**:  
   - A PatchGAN discriminator classifies whether image patches are real or fake.  

3. **Loss Functions**:  
   - Adversarial Loss: Binary cross-entropy.  
   - L1 Loss: Pixel-level reconstruction loss for better outputs.  

---

## **Training**  

Train the pix2pix model by running the following command in your environment:  
```python
train_pix2pix(generator, discriminator, pix2pix, X_train, Y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=1)
```

**Key Features**:  
- Logs progress every epoch.  
- Saves model weights and sample generated images at intervals.  

---

## **Results**  

### **Sample Generated Image**  
The generator learns to map input facades to corresponding semantic labels:  

| **Input Image**          | **Generated Image**         |  
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|  
| ![Input](assets/input.jpg) | ![Output](assets/output.jpg) |  

---

## **Testing**  

Once the model is trained, test the generator on unseen input images:  

```python
from keras.models import load_model

# Load the trained generator
generator = load_model('pix2pix_generator.h5')

# Generate an image
generated_image = generator.predict(tf.expand_dims(test_image, axis=0))

# Visualize the result
plt.imshow(generated_image[0])
plt.show()
```

---

## **Dependencies**  

- Python 3.8+  
- TensorFlow 2.x  
- Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- KaggleHub  

Install all dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## **Future Work**  

- Extend the project to other datasets like `edges2shoes` or `maps`.  
- Implement data augmentation for better generalization.  
- Use advanced GANs like CycleGAN for unpaired image translation tasks.
